This file contains the code for a modified version for the Game of Life.
It has been made using the pygame library and basic python, without using OOPs.
The modifications include:
1.Using hexagonal grid cells instead of the regular square ones.
2.Every dead cell resurrects after 6 generations irrespective of the number of live neighbors.
3.All the resurrected cells can not die by the way in which they previously died.
4.Every 4 generations a random dead cell comes to life irrespective of the number of live neighbors.
